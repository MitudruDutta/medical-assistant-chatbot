"What are the symptoms of hypertension?","Hypertension (high blood pressure) is often called a 'silent killer' because it typically has no symptoms. Some people may experience headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds, but these usually occur only when blood pressure is extremely high."
"Can antibiotics affect birth control?","If I am not mistaken, the Mayo Clinic studied this and said only one antibiotic has been shown to impact birth control's effectiveness at all. It is rifampin. Out of an abundance of caution, some doctors suggest using a second form of birth control for a month. I am not sure how much it is affecting your life now or how much an unwanted pregnancy would mess things up. I never bothered with an extra form of birth control because of antibiotics, but surely one month of a backup will not hurt."
"What should I do for a minor burn?","For a minor burn, cool the burn under cold running water for at least 10 minutes. After cooling, cover with a sterile, non-adhesive bandage or clean cloth. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever if needed. Do not apply butter, oil, or ointments to the burn as these can trap heat and cause infection."
"Is it normal to have heart palpitations?","Occasional heart palpitations are common and usually not cause for concern. They can be triggered by stress, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, or exercise. However, if you experience frequent or prolonged palpitations, especially with other symptoms like dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath, you should consult a doctor."
"How often should I check my blood pressure?","If your blood pressure is normal (less than 120/80 mm Hg), it's recommended to check it at least once every 2 years. If you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure or other risk factors, your doctor may recommend checking it more frequently, possibly daily or weekly."
"What are the side effects of statins?","Common side effects of statins include muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. Some people report memory issues or confusion. More severe side effects like liver damage or rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) are rare. Always discuss any side effects with your doctor as benefits often outweigh risks for those with high cholesterol."
"Is a fever always bad?","A fever is not always bad. It's actually a sign that your body is fighting an infection. For adults, a low-grade fever (up to 102°F/38.9°C) typically doesn't require treatment unless it's accompanied by other concerning symptoms or lasts more than a few days. However, higher fevers or fevers in infants may require medical attention."
"How do I know if I'm having a migraine?","Migraines often include a throbbing or pulsing pain, usually on one side of the head, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting. Some people experience an 'aura' before a migraine - visual disturbances like flashing lights or blind spots. Migraines typically last from 4 to 72 hours without treatment."
"What's the difference between a cold and the flu?","Colds and flu share some symptoms, but flu is typically more severe. Cold symptoms include runny/stuffy nose, sore throat, and mild fatigue that develop gradually. Flu comes on suddenly with fever, body aches, extreme fatigue, and headache. Flu can lead to serious complications like pneumonia, while colds rarely do."
"Are there natural ways to lower blood pressure?","Yes, there are several natural ways to lower blood pressure: maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly (aim for 150 minutes per week), reduce sodium intake, limit alcohol, avoid smoking, manage stress, and eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. The DASH diet was specifically designed for hypertension management."
